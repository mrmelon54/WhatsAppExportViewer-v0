View chats exported from WhatsApp.

To put your bubbles on the right-hand side you need to put your name into the settings (cog icon in the top right). Then try opening the exported chat again so the program can reparse and display your user correctly.

Exporting chats
---------------

You need to export your chats from WhatsApp to be able to view them.

To export them on Android devices follow these steps:

- Open a chat
- Press the triple dots
- Press more
- Press export chat

I'm not sure about on iPhones but I'm assuming the process is a bit similar.
